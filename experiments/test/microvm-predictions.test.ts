 * Spec §7.4 records five falsifiable predictions BEFORE the first rung, and says why

 *
 * So this test is not a schema check — it is a tamper seal. Editing a prediction after
 * results land fails here, loudly, and the only correct responses are (a) revert, or
 * (b) update this digest in the SAME commit that says in its message why a prediction
 * was legitimately restated. Both leave a trace; a silent edit does not.
